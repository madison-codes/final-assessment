# Final Assessment

([Project Specification](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/scrabble.html))

Introduction

In this assessment, you’ll be building a Scrabble scorer. You’ll do part of the project in preparation and then a second part pairing with an instructor.

Setup setups:

- Clonerepository.
- `npm install`
- `npm start` or `npm test`.

Preparation

Pre-baked Functionality

In order to have a decent scrabble score tracker, we’re going to need score some words. In an effort to save you time, here is a simple JavaScript object that stores the values for each letter.

const letterScores = {
  A: 1, B: 3, C: 3, D: 2,
  E: 1, F: 4, G: 2, H: 4,
  I: 1, J: 8, K: 5, L: 1,
  M: 3, N: 1, O: 1, P: 3,
  Q: 10, R: 1, S: 1, T: 1,
  U: 1, V: 4, W: 4, X: 8,
  Y: 4, Z: 10
}

In preparation, write the functions below. They should be covered by unit tests.

scoreWord() takes a word and returns the total score of the word.
scoreWord('hello') should return 8.
An empty string or any non-string (e.g. scoreWord('') or scoreWord(null)) should return 0.
The function should strip any whitespace before or after the word. scoreWorld(' hello ') should be the same as scoreWord('hello').
Score word should take an optional second argument for the word multiplier. scoreWord('hello', 2) should return 16.
Setup

You should come to the assessment with your project set up with webpack and configured for React and your scoreWord() function installed with a passing test suite.

During the assessment, you’ll build a UI for the Scrabble scorer based on instructions from an instructor.
